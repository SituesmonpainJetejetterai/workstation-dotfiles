# [Quotes and escaping](https://wiki.bash-hackers.org/syntax/quoting)

In summary:

> - **per-character escaping** using a backslash: `\$stuff`
> - **weak quoting** with double-quotes: `"stuff"`
> - **strong quoting** with single-quotes: `'stuff'`

> Bash provides another quoting mechanism: Strings that contain ANSI C-like escape sequences.

# [How to Use `$()` and `${}` Expansions in a Shell Script](https://linuxhint.com/use_expansions_shell_script/)

Basically, use `$()` to substitute bash commands (or functions), and `${}` to substitute a bash variable/parameter.


# [What does "{} \;" mean in the find command?](https://askubuntu.com/questions/339015/what-does-mean-in-the-find-command)

`find` has been very important for me, I just pushed a commit where I used it. The `\;` just tells `find` that you have executed the command and `find` can now exit.  
There is another suffix, i.e. `+`, but I haven't used it yet.

## Extra resources:

- [This](https://stackoverflow.com/a/2962015) link shows how to run bash commands using `exec` in `find`. Very impressive.
- The rest of the answers are worthwhile too, I found another showing how to run multiple `exec`s in `find`.

# [`xargs: unmatched single quote; by default quotes are special to xargs unless you use the -0 option`](https://www.reddit.com/r/bash/comments/pl1ukb/xargs_unmatched_single_quote_by_default_quotes/)

> Some of the file names found by `find` contained a single quote like in `let's dance.txt`. `xargs` treats quotes special way by default:

> To prevent that behaviour, use `-print0` with `find` and `-0` with`xargs`.

`unalias <name>`

This is because on sourcing `.bashrc`, it can only update existing aliases and functions. It does not start from scratch.

# `sed`

- To select different elements in the input with `sed`, use `\(.*\)` to partition the input. Then, substitute it with something like `\1`.
    - Example: If I have a string like `origin main`, and I wanted `origin:main`, I'd do `s/\(.*\)\s\(.*\)/\1:\2/`.

# Using flags in shell (POSIX)

`getopts` is a POSIX defined utility to utilise flags (or switches) with a shell script/command/function and the like.  
`getopts` is generally run in a while loop to iterate over the provided flags and check for each one separately.  
Its behaviour would be easier to explain with an example:
```sh
while getopts ":hb:o:" opt; do
    case ${opt} in
        h)
            help
            ;;
        b)
            name="$OPTARG"
            printf "\n%s" "${name}"
            ;;
        o)
            name="$OPTARG"
            printf "\n%s" "${name}"
            ;;
        :)
            printf "\n%s" "Missing argument: source file to copy"
            exit 1
            ;;
        \?)
            printf "\n%s%s" "Invalid option: " "${OPTARG}"
            exit 1
            ;;
        *)
            printf "\n%s" "You are useless. Try again"
            help
            exit 1
            ;;
    esac
done
```

## Syntax
- The basic syntax of `getopts` is: `getopts optstring name [arg...]`.
- In this example, `optstring` is `:hb:o:`.
- Any flag in the `optstring` which needs an input should be followed by a `:`. For example, `h` is not followed by a colon, while `b` and `o` are, thus they require option-arguments.
- `name` is `opt`.
- The arguments are generally defined while executing the script in the shell (like, name of a file).
- `help` is a function I had used in the original script to show the usage of the script.

## Usage
I will be using this resource (it is honestly amazing how `getopts` is explained in such detail in just one page): [getopts](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/getopts.html)
- The various options in the `case-esac` statement are the choice of flags available to the user.
- The first three options, i.e. `h`, `o` and `b` are the accepted (and defined) flags for this script.
- The rest of the options, i.e. `:`, `\?` and `*` are cases to handle scenarios like "No argument specified", "Invalid option" and "The rest" (in that order).
    - I realise that this part will need some explanation.
    - The case of `$name` (`$opt` in the case of this example) being set to `:` means that, after parsing the available flags, `getopts` encounters a case of missing option-argument, it will set `$OPTARG` to the argument found (note that there is no argument, which means that `$OPTARG` becomes blank). This is not an error, however if you try to print `$OPTARG` you will get a blank line. The relevant quotes from the page mentioned above are:
        - > If an option-argument is missing:
        - > If the first character of optstring is a <colon>, the shell variable specified by name shall be set to the <colon> character and the shell variable OPTARG shall be set to the option character found.
    - If `$name` (`$opt` in this case) is set to `?`, it means that the option character used while executing the script was not found; i.e. it is an illegal character. Note that we need to "escape" the `?`, using `\?` in the `case-esac` statement. The relevant quotes are:
        - > If an option character not contained in the optstring operand is found where an option character is expected, the shell variable specified by name shall be set to the <question-mark> ( '?' ) character. In this case, if the first character in optstring is a <colon> ( ':' ), the shell variable OPTARG shall be set to the option character found, but no output shall be written to standard error
        - > This condition shall be considered to be an error detected in the way arguments were presented to the invoking application, but shall not be an error in `getopts` processing.
    - And for any other case, the `*` is a `case-esac` specific option to handle cases not already defined.
- And on the `$OPTIND` variable;
    - > When the end of options is encountered, the `getopts` utility shall exit with a return value greater than zero; the shell variable `OPTIND` shall be set to the index of the first operand, or the value "$#" +1 if there are no operands; the name variable shall be set to the <question-mark> character. Any of the following shall identify the end of options: the first "--" argument that is not an option-argument, finding an argument that is not an option-argument and does not begin with a '-', or encountering an error.

The search for `getopts` was encouraged by [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/bash/comments/qtmbtg/small_script_to_make_a_backup_file_can_somebody/) Reddit post (and the GitHub gist mentioned in it).
