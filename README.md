# Setting up stuff 

This will be a repository documenting how I set up/will be setting up various things, mostly software. 

Intended for personal use, however it's free to the world, if anybody is looking for a reference.

## Basic setup

I've not written any script for this yet, so it's a bit manual.

I need to symlink all the configuration files from the repository to the relevant directory (`$HOME`).

*For vim*\
`ln -s vim/.vim ~/.vim`

*For tmux*\
`ln -s tmux/.tmux.conf ~/.tmux.conf`

*For bash*\
`ln -s bash/.bashrc ~/.bashrc`
